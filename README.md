# Pirate Intelligent Agent: Deep Q-Learning

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of a pirate intelligent agent that utilizes deep Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique, to navigate a maze in search of treasure. The maze is represented as an 8x8 grid with obstacles, and the agent is trained to find the optimal path to the treasure while avoiding obstacles. This project showcases the application of key concepts in reinforcement learning and neural networks to solve a real-world problem.

## Work Summary

### Provided Code

In this project, I was given the following foundational code:

- **Maze Environment:** The structure and behavior of the maze, including the position of obstacles and the treasure.
- **Basic Reinforcement Learning Framework:** An initial framework for setting up the reinforcement learning environment, including placeholders for actions, state observations, and a general approach to building the training loop.
- **Experience Replay and Model Setup:** Basic implementations for experience replay and the initialization of the neural network model.

### Code Created by Me

I developed the following key components:

- **Q-Training Function:** I implemented the `qtrain` function which handles the training loop for the deep Q-learning process. My implementation includes setting up the number of epochs, memory management, handling exploration versus exploitation, and calculating loss after each training iteration. I also implemented mechanisms to track the win rate and determine when the training process should stop based on performance metrics.
  
- **Parameter Adjustments:** My code also involves parameter tuning, such as controlling the `epsilon` decay for exploration, setting the memory size for experience replay, and determining the batch size for training. These parameters are crucial for the agent's learning efficiency and effectiveness.
  
- **Training Progress Output:** I created detailed output statements within the training loop that provide insights into the training progress, including the current epoch, loss, number of episodes, win rate, and the time taken for training. This helps in monitoring and debugging the training process.

### Adjustments Made

Compared to the provided code, I made several adjustments to improve the training process:

- **Epoch Management:** I adjusted the number of epochs and the conditions under which training stops, based on the agent's win rate and overall performance.
  
- **Memory and Data Management:** I customized the maximum memory for storing past experiences and the data size used for training the model, balancing between sufficient exploration and computational efficiency.

- **Completion Check Enhancement:** I enhanced the completion check logic to ensure that the model could reliably solve the maze from any free starting position, indicating robust learning.

## Reflection on Learning

### Connection to Computer Science

Throughout this course, I gained a deeper understanding of the role of computer scientists in solving complex, real-world problems using advanced algorithms and computational techniques. Computer scientists are tasked with not only developing solutions that are technically sound but also ensuring that these solutions are efficient, scalable, and ethically responsible.

### Approach to Problem-Solving

As a computer scientist, approaching a problem involves a systematic process of understanding the problem domain, designing algorithms that can effectively address the problem, and rigorously testing these solutions to ensure they perform as expected. In this project, I approached the problem by first understanding the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, then applying these principles to train an intelligent agent capable of making autonomous decisions in a dynamic environment.

### Ethical Responsibilities

In this project, and in the broader field of computer science, ethical responsibilities are paramount. It is crucial to consider the implications of the technology we create, especially when it interacts with users or processes sensitive information. My responsibilities include ensuring data privacy, preventing biased or harmful outcomes from AI decisions, and maintaining transparency in how algorithms make decisions. These ethical considerations guide not only the development of AI systems but also their deployment and continued monitoring.
